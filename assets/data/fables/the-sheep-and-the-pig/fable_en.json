You would have thought, to hear the loud squealing, that the Pig was being cruelly hurt.</p><p>But in spite of its squeals and struggles to escape, the Shepherd tucked his prize under his arm and started off to the butcher's in the market place.</p><p>The Sheep in the pasture were much astonished and amused at the Pig's behavior, and followed the Shepherd and his charge to the pasture gate.</p><p><q>What makes you squeal like that?</q> asked one of the Sheep. <q>The Shepherd often catches and carries off one of us. But we should feel very much ashamed to make such a terrible fuss about it like you do.</q></p><p><q>That is all very well,</q> replied the Pig, with a squeal and a frantic kick. <q>When he catches you he is only after your wool.
