Knowing that the bear would eat all the honey, the little bee stung him sharply on the nose and flew back into the log.</p><p>This flew the bear into an angry rage. He swatted at the log with his big claws, determined to destroy the nest of bees inside.</p><p>This only alerted the bees and quick as a wink, the entire swarm of bees flew out of the log and began to sting the bear from head to heel. The bear saved himself by running to and diving into the nearest pond.</p>","moral":"It is better to bear a single injury in silence than to bring about a thousand by reacting in anger.","voicePath":"fables/the-bear-and-the-bees/voice_en.mp3"}],"tags":["animal","insect"],"related":[3,4,10,12,23,32,33,35,42,44,45,46,51,55,56,61,62,63,68,72,73,77,78,79,85,97,99]}
