Then one fine day in early spring he found himself with not a penny left, and no property save the clothes he wore.</p><p>He was to meet some jolly young men that morning, and he was at his wits' end how to get enough money to keep up appearances. Just then a Swallow flew by, twittering merrily, and the young man, thinking summer had come, hastened off to a clothes dealer, to whom he sold all the clothes he wore down to his very tunic.</p><p>A few days later a change in weather brought a severe frost; and the poor swallow and that foolish young man in his light tunic, and with his arms and knees bare, could scarcely keep life in their shivering bodies.</p>","moral":"One swallow does not make a summer.","voicePath":null}],"tags":["human","bird"],"related":[0,3,5,6,13,15,18,21,23,24,25,26,28,29,36,43,47,49,57,58,60,64,65,68,69,70,74,75,79,81,83,84,94,99]}
