But at last he determined to put a bolder face upon his misfortune, and summoned all the foxes to a general meeting to consider a proposal which he had to place before them.</p><p>When they had assembled together the Fox proposed that they should all do away with their tails. He pointed out how inconvenient a tail was when they were pursued by their enemies, the dogs; how much it was in the way when they desired to sit down and hold a friendly conversation with one another. He failed to see any advantage in carrying about such a useless encumbrance.</p><p><q>That is all very well,</q> said one of the older foxes; <q>but I do not think you would have recommended us to dispense with our chief ornament if you had not happened to lose it yourself</q>.</p>","moral":"Distrust interested advice.","voicePath":null}],"tags":["fox"],"related":[2,9,16,21,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,53,54,55,67,85]}
