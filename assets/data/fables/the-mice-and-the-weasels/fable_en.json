The generals, not being able to get in on account of the ornaments on their heads, were all captured and eaten by the Weasels.</p>","moral":"The more honor the more danger.","voicePath":null}],"tags":["mouse","animal"],"related":[1,10,11,17,32,33,35,39,44,45,46,52,55,61,62,63,73,77,78,79,80,85,97,99]}
