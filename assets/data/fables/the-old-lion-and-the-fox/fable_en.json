And when they came to offer him their sympathy, he ate them up one by one.</p><p>The Fox came too, but he was very cautious about it. Standing at a safe distance from the cave, he inquired politely after the Lion's health.</p><p>The Lion replied that he was very ill indeed, and asked the Fox to step in for a moment. But Master Fox very wisely stayed outside, thanking the Lion very kindly for the invitation.</p><p><q>I should be glad to do as you ask,</q> he added, <q>but I have noticed that there are many footprints leading into your cave and none coming out. Pray tell me, how do your visitors find their way out again?</q></p>","moral":"Take warning from the misfortunes of others.","voicePath":null}],"tags":["fox","lion"],"related":[2,9,16,21,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,50,51,52,53,54,55,74,85,93,98]}
