The Shepherd suspected a Wolf of the deed and so set out toward a rocky region among the hills, where there were caves infested by Wolves.</p><p>But before starting out he made a vow to Jupiter that if he would help him find the thief he would offer a fat Calf as a sacrifice.</p><p>The Shepherd searched a long time without finding any Wolves, but just as he was passing near a large cave on the mountain side, a huge Lion stalked out, carrying a Sheep. In great terror the Shepherd fell on his knees.</p><p><q>Alas, O Jupiter, man does not know what he asks! To find the thief I offered to sacrifice a fat Calf. Now I promise you a full-grown Bull, if you make the thief go away!</q></p>","moral":"Do not foolishly ask for things that would bring ruin if they were granted.","voicePath":null}],"tags":["lion","human"],"related":[2,5,6,13,25,26,34,43,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,57,58,60,64,65,67,75,76,81,83,93,94,98,99]}
