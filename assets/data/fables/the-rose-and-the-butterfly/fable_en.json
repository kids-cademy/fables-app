It was a long time before he came back to her.</p><p><q>Is this your constancy?</q> she exclaimed tearfully. <q>It is ages since you went away, and all the time, you have been carrying on with all sorts of flowers. I saw you kiss Miss Geranium, and you fluttered around Miss Mignonette until Honey Bee chased you away. I wish he had stung you!</q></p><p><q>Constancy!</q> laughed the Butterfly. <q>I had no sooner left you than I saw Zephyr kissing you.
