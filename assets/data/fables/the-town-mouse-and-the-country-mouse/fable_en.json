Beans and bacon, cheese and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely.</p><p>The Town Mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare, and said: <q>I cannot understand, Cousin, how you can put up with such poor food as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in the country; come you with me and I will show you how to live. When you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life.</q></p><p>No sooner said than done: the two mice set off for the town and arrived at the Town Mouse's residence late at night.</p><p><q>You will want some refreshment after our long journey,</q> said the polite Town Mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining-room. There they found the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all that was nice.</p><p>Suddenly they heard growling and barking. <q>What is that?</q> said the Country Mouse. <q>It is only the dogs of the house,</q> answered the other. <q>Only!</q> said the Country Mouse. <q>I do not like that music at my dinner.</q></p><p>Just at that moment the door flew open, in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had to scamper down and run off. <q>Good-bye, Cousin,</q> said the Country Mouse.</p>","moral":"Better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear.","voicePath":null}],"tags":["mouse"],"related":[1,17,39,52,56]}
