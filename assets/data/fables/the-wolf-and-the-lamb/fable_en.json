I cannot possibly muddy the water you are drinking up there. Remember, you are upstream and I am downstream.</q></p><p><q>You do muddy it!</q> retorted the Wolf savagely. <q>And besides, I have heard that you told lies about me last year!</q></p><p><q>How could I have done so?</q> pleaded the Lamb. <q>I wasn't born until this year.</q></p><p><q>If it wasn't you, it was your brother!</q></p><p><q>I have no brothers.</q></p><p><q>Well, then,</q> snarled the Wolf, <q>It was someone in your family anyway.
