The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.</p><p>Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.</p><p><q>What a fool I am,</q> he said. <q>Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for.</q></p><p>And off he walked very, very scornfully.</p>","moral":"There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.","voicePath":null}],"tags":["fox"],"related":[2,9,16,21,29,30,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,53,54,55,67,85]}
